# Best-move-predictor-for-Chess
Use Python to evaluate chess positions in under two seconds.
 I used the OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) and NumPy libraries to screenshot the chessboard, visualize the chessboard squares, and compare differences between images. I encourage you to learn more about OpenCV if you are unfamiliar with it. Next, I used PIL (pillow) library to modify images (e.g., cropping). The CompareImages module uses OpenCV to find and highlight the differences between the two images. I slightly modified the code from CodeDeepAI, which is HERE, and you can download the module from my GitHub page. The mss library is a fast and easy way to grab a screenshot of the monitor and save the image as a PNG file. Next, I used the chess library for move generation, validation, and visualization. Finally, I used the stockfish engine for evaluating chess positions and identifying the best moves. You can download the Stockfish engine from their website. I am using Stockfish 14.1 (AVX2) in Windows for this project.
